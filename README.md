# Coffee_shop
This program is a simple coffee shop simulator. You can order hot, cold drinks and
also some food. All components are stored in database(Microsoft SQL Server). 
So if you want to add product, from the beginning you can press button and open form 
where you can add item. You must enter description of product(americano or milkshake), price,
choose catagory. In our case there are three catagories : hot drinks, cold drinks, other(food). 
And in the end you need to enter product id. Also you can open view form where in tables you can 
see or follow which items are stored in database. There you can delete item by clicking in the 
appropriate place on the tables and in textbox will appear product which you selected. After pressing 
button(delete item) it disappear from database. Another function is filtering by catagory in order to
follow product. When you open main form(coffe_shop)you press on item and choose
products which would be added in listbox where you also can see total sum. In the list you can click on item and the press button 
in order to delete it. If you press pay after you can see form where you have to enter appropriate 
sum of monney. if you enter less sum than needed, program give an error. After entering correct data
you can print check with information about all products that customer ordered, sum of money in order 
to pay, entering sum, rest(difference between enetring sum and sum you have to pay) and todat`s date.
